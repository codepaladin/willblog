After you log in, you want to get the quest from Somi. She will tell you to start by killing 5 bandits. Then go back to Somi and she will tell you to kill 2 more bandits while rescuing her sister. Finally, you will kill the bandit boss. You should do that until you get to level 10. Once you get to level 10, follow the path which will lead to the Zapiwara Cave. Go to Membere outside the cave and he will give you a quest to kill three Sakurai Demons. Keep doing that quest until you get to level 12.
