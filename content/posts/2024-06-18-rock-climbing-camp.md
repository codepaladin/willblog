FINALLY!!! I’m going to rock climbing camp and I just can’t do two of the walls, which are the hardest. when I started to lose, hope someone offered to show me what to do. I was super excited!

They did it a different way than what I would do

And finally, I was able to do one of the hardest walls on the Rockwall!
