Wouldn't it be cool to have super powers?

Something I think would be really cool is Ergokinesis because you would have super powers. Ergokinesis gives people the ability to manipulate energy forms. These energy forms are such as electricity, fire, gravity, light, ect.

Ergokinesis can be used to make any forms like blasts, beams, bolts, rays, waves, ect. The user would also be able to use it on the environment by shaping what the environment looks like or extracting the energy

If I had Ergokinesis I would become a superhero. If I could control gravity, I could fly. If I could control electricity I wouldnâ€™t have to charge my iPad.
