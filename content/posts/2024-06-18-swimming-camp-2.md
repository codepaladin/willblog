All right, camp wasn’t actually that bad. I made a friend, but nobody I knew was there. My new friend is called Jordan. On the diving boards at the pool, we see if we can touch the bottom of the pool! It is super fun, I’m always so close to touching the bottom! I haven’t done it yet, but I have a whole week, don’t I? At camp, we have a choice between playing with the inner tubes, or the diving boards. I always pick diving boards because they’re the best! And my new friend does, too! I can’t wait for tomorrow to come, because I know I’m gonna touch the bottom of the pool this time! But the only bad part is that musty crusty pool hair that you get after going in. I just can’t wait for tomorrow!
