      <description>All right, camp wasn’t actually that bad. I made a friend, but nobody I knew was there. My new friend is called Jordan. On the diving boards at the pool, we see if we can touch the bottom of the pool! It is super fun, I’m always so close to touching the bottom! I haven’t done it yet, but I have a whole week, don’t I? At camp, we have a choice between playing with the inner tubes, or the diving boards.</description>
