      <description>OMG, camp is starting tomorrow and I am so excited! It is a new camp that I have never been to! My parents say that it is a swimming camp. I’ve never really been to an all swimming camp, so this is gonna be fun. Whenever my best friend comes over, we always swim together! So this is going to be a fun time, even though she’s not gonna be there.</description>
